## Introduction

This repo hopes to foster a community around the Gorilla Web Toolkit project, which was archived on December 9, 2022.  The hope is to gather enough dedicated contributors to continue development.  

## Main Goal

The long-term goal is to gain enough developer resources and code insight where we could propose to the previous maintainers about unarchiving the original Gorilla repo and allowing us to continue maintaining it there.

## How Can You Help?

- help with fixing issues, gathering more information and proposing a solution in code
- create and review pull requests
- improve documentation
