## Introduction

This repo hopes to foster a community around the Gorilla Web Toolkit project, which was archived on December 9, 2022.  The hope is to gather enough dedicated contributors to continue development.  

## Main Goal

The long-term goal is to gain enough developer resources and code insight where we could propose to the previous maintainers about unarchiving the original Gorilla repo and allowing us to continue maintaining it there.

## How You Can Help

We need people to help manage the following projects:

- WebSockets - https://github.com/Gorilla-Incubator/websocket
- Mux - https://github.com/Gorilla-Incubator/mux
- Sessions - https://github.com/Gorilla-Incubator/sessions
- Secure Cookie - https://github.com/Gorilla-Incubator/securecookie

If there's enough interest in other Gorilla projects (i.e. csrf, handlers, schema, etc) then we can add those too.

## Other Ways To Help

- help with fixing issues, gathering more information and proposing a solution in code
- create and review pull requests
- improve documentation
