## Introduction

This repo hopes to foster a community around the Gorilla Web Toolkit project, which was archived on December 9, 2022.  The hope is to gather enough dedicated contributors to continue development.  

## Main Goal

The long-term goal is to gain enough developer resources and code insight where we could propose to the previous maintainers about unarchiving the original Gorilla repo and allowing us to continue maintaining it there.

## How You Can Help

#### Help advance the project

If you can commit long-term and want to help manage sub-projects, then I can invite you to become a member of the organization and put you on a team.  Specifically, I need people who can be on top of addressing issues, review and test pull requests, etc.  Help with prioritizing issues and PRs that are relevant to the project.  Let me know which team you want to be part a part of:

- **WebSockets** - https://github.com/GorillaIncubator/websocket
- **Mux** - https://github.com/orgs/GorillaIncubator/mux
- **Sessions** - https://github.com/GorillaIncubator/sessions
- **Secure Cookie** - https://github.com/GorillaIncubator/securecookie

If there's enough interest in other Gorilla projects (i.e. csrf, handlers, schema, etc) then we can add those too.

#### Help as a community member

- **Issues**:  discuss issues to gain more insight into the problem, gathering more information and proposing a solution in code
- **Pull Requests**:  create, review, and test pull requests
- **Documentation**:  improve documentation, whether that be in the source code itself or in a separate guide for users and developers
- **Learning Resources**:  create examples and tutorials to help others learn how to use the project
